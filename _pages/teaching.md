# Future Teaching Directions

## Analog Electronics (Basic and Advanced Level) ##

In the first part of the course, I would like to teach an overview, applications, fundamentals, and design flow of the state-of-the-art integrated circuits (IC) and systems. Course contents include the fabrication process, diodes, bipolar transistors, and MOS transistors and modes of operations, and fundamentals of analog, digital, and mixed-signal IC design.

In the second part of the course, I would like to teach Noise analysis, Advanced op-amp design techniques, Analog VLSI building blocks: multipliers, oscillators, mixers, phase-locked loops, A/D and D/A converters, Passive filter design, Frequency scaling, Active filter design.

## Mixed-signal IC Design 

This course aims to systematically introduce major issues of mixed-signal circuit designs and their applications in bio-medical and sensory systems. The first half course is dedicated to mixed-signal IC design. The course starts with 2 review classes on OPAMP design, filter design, and circuit noise. Then, the course covers topics on pipelined ADC, Sigma-delta ADC, and SAR ADC. The second half course is dedicated to sensory and bio-medical IC design. The topics include bio-potential detection, implants, DNA detection, CCD, CMOS imaging, and CT/SPECT.

## Power Management IC Design (Part 1 and 2) ##

This course aims to teach Integrated circuit techniques for power management components such as voltage references, linear voltage regulators, low dropout regulators, switch mode power converters and switched-capacitor power converters.
