# Future Teaching Directions

## Analog Electronics (Basic and Advanced Level) ##

In the first part of the course, I would like to teach an overview, applications, fundamentals, and design flow of the state-of-the-art integrated circuits (IC) and systems. Course contents include the fabrication process, diodes, bipolar transistors, and MOS transistors and modes of operations, and fundamentals of analog, digital, and mixed-signal IC design.

In the second part of the course, I would like to teach Noise analysis, Advanced op-amp design techniques, Analog VLSI building blocks: multipliers, oscillators, mixers, phase-locked loops, A/D and D/A converters, Passive filter design, Frequency scaling, Active filter design.

## Mixed-signal IC Design 

## Power Management IC Design (Part 1 and 2) ##

## Biomedical Instrumentation (Focus area - Wearable and Implantable Medical Devices) ##

# At HKUST
