I am currently a postdoctoral scholar from the Integrated Power Electronics laboratory at the Electronics and Computer Engineering Department in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was born and brought up in India and completed my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India. After my graduation, I briefly worked at Coal India, a Fortune 500 company, for almost two years. There, I understood the demand for a multipurpose wearable device to cope with the increasing degree of automation and reduce manual intervention in the industrial environment. Later, based on that knowledge, I developed my start-up "Wecare Medservice LLP" in the wearable domain and won the top start-up competitions in India. In my startup, I mostly worked on the cardiorespiratory and biochemical signal processing domain and developed a beta prototype for a multiparameter monitoring wearable for performance enhancement in working-class people. I realized my increasing interest in high-end CMOS design during my start-up days. So, I decided to pursue PhD at HKUST under Prof Wing Hung Ki. My thesis topic is “power and data transmission efficacy improvement of the on-chip encrypted implantable medical device”.  My work during PhD opens up avenues for a closely packed encrypted retinal stimulation system. 

My research interest can be broadly classified into four segments.

## Inductive or Ultrasonically Powered Secured Implantable Medical Devices for Neural/Retinal/Auditory Stimulation 
I would like to develop a secured reconfigurable multimodal neurostimulator system on a chip (SoC) design that can record, process, and stimulate deep brain activity in humans/animals. Each recording channel changes its configuration depending on whether the channel is assigned to record voltage [action potentials and single-neuron LFP activity during stationary and ambulatory behavior in humans local field potential (LFP)] or current signal (concentration of neurotransmitters). It can lead to impactful discoveries within the neuroscience field and contribute to the development of novel therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. 

## Machine Learning or Deep learning-based Biosignal Processing (ex. - cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation, Signal Quality Estimation)

## Wireless Multimodality System-on-a-chip Design for Biochemical (sweat/urine) and Physiological (ECG, PPG) Signal Acquisition

## Power Management IC Design for Edge Devices
