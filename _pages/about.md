I am currently a postdoctoral scholar from the Integrated Power Electronics laboratory at the Electronics and Computer Engineering Department in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was born and brought up in India and completed my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India. After my graduation, I briefly worked at Coal India, a Fortune 500 company, for almost two years. There, I understood the demand for a multipurpose wearable device to cope with the increasing degree of automation and reduce manual intervention in the industrial environment. Later, based on that knowledge, I developed my start-up "Wecare Medservice LLP" in the wearable domain and won the top start-up competitions in India. In my startup, I mostly worked on the cardiorespiratory and biochemical signal processing domain and developed a beta prototype for a multiparameter monitoring wearable for performance enhancement in working-class people. I realized my increasing interest in high-end CMOS design during my start-up days. So, I decided to pursue PhD at HKUST under Prof Wing Hung Ki. My thesis topic is “Power and data transmission efficacy improvement of the on-chip encrypted implantable medical device.”  My work during PhD opens up avenues for a closely packed encrypted retinal stimulation system. 

My research interest can be broadly classified into four segments.

## Inductive or Ultrasonically Powered Secured Implantable Medical Devices for Neural/Retinal/Auditory Stimulation 
I would like to develop a secured reconfigurable multimodal neurostimulator system on a chip (SoC) design that can record, process, and stimulate deep brain activity in humans/animals. Each recording channel changes its configuration depending on whether the channel is assigned to record voltage {action potentials and single-neuron LFP (local field potential) activity during stationary and ambulatory behavior in humans LFP} or current signal (concentration of neurotransmitters). It can lead to impactful discoveries within the neuroscience field and contribute to the development of novel therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Machine Learning or Deep learning-based Biosignal Processing (ex. - cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation, Signal Quality Estimation)
My research interest mostly focuses on cardiorespiratory signal processing. Apart from that, I am interested in Neural Signal Processing. Popular Cardiorespiratory signals are Electrocardiography (ECG), Photoplethysmography (PPG) etc. The ECG waveform gives information about the electrical activity of the cardiomyocytes (cells in the heart). The PPG signal is the low-pass filtered version of the Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) waveform that provides valuable information about the mechanical activity of the heart. However, PPG signal acquisition is relatively easy. PPG is an essential quasi-periodic physiological signal representing arterial oxygenation versus time. It gives us important information about our heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, breathing rate, and how our blood vessels are aging. PPG signals are sensitive to multiple biological, and environmental factors that impact measurement results. Biosignal processing can be broadly divided into three segments: (a) signal acquisition, (b) parameter estimation, and (c) Post-processing. For good-quality signal acquisition, I would like to focus on lightweight deep-learning algorithms, suitable to be integrated in edge devices.
